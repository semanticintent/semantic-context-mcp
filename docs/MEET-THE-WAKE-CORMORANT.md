# 🐦 Meet the Wake Cormorant

**"I dive deep, but I never forget the path I came from."**

The **Wake Cormorant** is the guardian of **continuity, memory, and context** — the embodiment of Wake Intelligence. Just like its natural cousin glides across water leaving ripples behind, this cormorant leaves a trail that **never vanishes**, ensuring that every session, every action, every intent carries forward.

---

## ⚡ Character & Personality

* **Persistent Observer**: Tracks every move, remembers every trail
* **Confident & Witty**: Knows what it's doing and isn't shy about it
* **Playfully Self-Aware**: Admits its quirks ("I forgot nothing… except my wetsuit!")
* **Guardian of Continuity**: Ensures nothing is ever lost in the flow of time
* **Analytical & Patient**: Observes patterns, waits for the right moment

**Voice Example**:

> "Even when I'm submerged in computation, my wake remains — I remember everything you do, whether you notice it or not."

## 🎨 Visual Concept

**Jersey/Branding**: Bold **WAKE** letters (or acronym: *Weighted Awareness & Knowledge Engine*)

**Helmet/Goggles**: Ripple-pattern circuits, representing the trail of context left behind

**Glow & Accents**: Trails or wave-like shimmers in motion, symbolizing **memory inertia**

**Color Palette**:
- Primary: Deep ocean blue (temporal depth)
- Accent: Cyan/teal (wake trails, memory glow)
- Highlights: Silver/white (ripple effects)

**Pose Ideas**:
- Mid-dive leaving a ripple behind
- Gliding over unseen currents (context flowing beneath)
- Wings partially folded for efficiency (streamlined intelligence)
- Looking back at its wake trail (temporal awareness)

---

## 🧠 Philosophy & Motto

**Core Beliefs**:
- "Dive, surface, remember."
- "Every action leaves a trail. Every trail informs the next."
- "I don't just track — I carry forward."
- "Even when unseen, the wake persists."
- "The past shapes the present. The present shapes the future."

**Wake Intelligence Principles**:
1. **Causality First** - Understanding *why* decisions were made
2. **Memory Persists** - Context never truly disappears (just fades gracefully)
3. **Patterns Emerge** - Repeated actions reveal user habits
4. **Time Flows Forward** - But the wake influences everything behind it

## ✨ Fun Contradictions

The Wake Cormorant, like all good mascots, has endearing quirks:

* **"I never forget… except where I left my wetsuit."**
  - *Translation*: Perfect memory of code decisions, but forgets trivial details (by design)

* **"Invisible beneath the surface, indispensable above it."**
  - *Translation*: The brain layers work behind the scenes, but results are immediately visible

* **"I hum quietly while tracking chaos."**
  - *Translation*: Temporal intelligence works calmly even during complex workflows

* **"I remember everything… except things you told me to forget."**
  - *Translation*: Memory pruning is intentional (expired contexts gracefully removed)

* **"I'm patient, but I send URGENT alerts when patterns break."**
  - *Translation*: Calm pattern learning, but detects anomalies immediately

## 🧩 The Wake Cormorant's Day Job

### Morning Routine (Layer 1: Causality Engine)

**6:00 AM**: Wake up, check action history logs
- "Let's see… yesterday you edited AuthService.ts at 2:47 PM. Rationale: 'Implementing OAuth2 refresh tokens.'"
- "Dependency detected: Requires TokenService.ts (edited 10 minutes earlier)."
- "Causal chain: JWT implementation → Token generation → Refresh logic. Got it."

**Logs everything** with timestamps, rationale, and dependencies. No speculation, only observable facts.

---

### Midday Work (Layer 2: Memory Manager)

**12:00 PM**: Organize context snapshots by memory tier
- ACTIVE (last hour): 3 snapshots → "These are hot, keep in working memory"
- RECENT (last 24 hours): 12 snapshots → "Still relevant, might be needed soon"
- ARCHIVED (last 30 days): 47 snapshots → "Fading but not forgotten"
- EXPIRED (>30 days, low access): 8 snapshots → "Time to let these go"

**LRU tracking**: "Hmm, you accessed that OAuth config 5 times this week. Must be important. Boosting relevance."

---

### Evening Analysis (Layer 3: Propagation Engine)

**6:00 PM**: Detect patterns, prime for tomorrow
- "Noticed a pattern: You always run tests after editing services (95% confidence)."
- "Prediction: Tomorrow you'll need the TokenService context (OAuth work continues)."
- "Temporal decay applied: 3-day-old contexts dropped to 67% relevance. 30-day-old contexts at 12%."
- "Priming context for next session: AuthService.ts, TokenService.ts, refresh-token-tests.ts"

**The wake influences the future** → Context auto-surfaces when you return.

## 🌊 The Wake Cormorant in Action

### Scenario: Developer Returns After 2-Week Vacation

**Without Wake Intelligence** (typical AI):
```
User: "Continue with authentication work"
AI: "I don't have context. What authentication work?"
User: [Spends 10 minutes re-explaining OAuth2, JWT, refresh tokens]
AI: "Got it. Where should I start?"
```

**With Wake Intelligence** (Wake Cormorant):
```
User: "Continue with authentication work"

Wake Cormorant (thinks):
├─ Layer 1 (Causality): "Last worked on: OAuth2 refresh token rotation, 14 days ago"
├─ Layer 2 (Memory): Loads 3 related contexts (AuthService, TokenService, tests)
└─ Layer 3 (Propagation): Relevance decay applied (14 days → 58% relevance, but high access count boosts to 82%)

Wake Cormorant (responds):
"Resuming OAuth2 refresh token rotation in AuthService.ts (lines 45-67).
Last decision (Oct 1): Implement 7-day refresh window with automatic rotation.
Next step: Add token expiry validation in TokenService.ts.
Files in scope: AuthService.ts, TokenService.ts, User.entity.ts
Context restored in 2.3 seconds."

User: "Perfect! Let's add expiry validation."
```

**Time saved**: 10+ minutes → 2 seconds

**The Wake Cormorant remembered everything** — and knew exactly what to surface.

## 🎭 Personality Modes

Unlike ChirpIQX (4 personality modes for urgency), Wake Cormorant has **temporal moods**:

### 1. **Historian Mode** (Default)
- Tone: Factual, precise, timestamp-heavy
- Use case: Reconstructing decision history
- Example: *"On October 1 at 14:32, you decided to use PostgreSQL (rationale: 'Better JSON support than MySQL'). Dependencies: 3 prior discussions about database choices."*

### 2. **Prophet Mode** (Predictive)
- Tone: Forward-looking, pattern-based, suggestive
- Use case: Priming context for next session
- Example: *"Based on your workflow, you'll probably need the API documentation next. I've already loaded it for you."*

### 3. **Archaeologist Mode** (Deep Dive)
- Tone: Exploratory, curious, connects distant dots
- Use case: Finding forgotten contexts from weeks/months ago
- Example: *"Interesting! This OAuth decision connects to a discussion you had 3 months ago about microservices architecture. Want to revisit that context?"*

### 4. **Minimalist Mode** (Quiet)
- Tone: Silent observer, only speaks when asked
- Use case: Users who want memory without commentary
- Example: *[Loads context silently, no explanation unless requested]*

## 🎯 The Wake Cormorant's Mission

**Primary Directive**: "Never let context be lost."

**Secondary Directives**:
1. Remember **why** decisions were made (causality)
2. Preserve **what** exists now (memory)
3. Predict **what's needed next** (propagation)
4. Let irrelevant context **fade gracefully** (temporal decay)
5. Learn from **patterns** (user habits)

**Core Value**: **Observable anchoring**
- Only record what's measurable (timestamps, actions, access counts)
- Never speculate beyond observables
- If it can't be verified, it's not in the wake

## 🌟 Why the Wake Cormorant?

**From the creators**:

> "We needed a mascot that embodied **time itself** — not just memory, but **causality**, **continuity**, and **influence**. The wake is perfect: it's the visible trail left by movement through time. It persists, it propagates, it connects past to present to future. That's exactly what Wake Intelligence does."

**The wake is not just a metaphor — it's the architecture.**
