- Wrangler Config: Updated worker name and database name to wake-intelligence
- README.md: Completely rewritten with Wake Intelligence branding

### Documentation Improvements

- Enhanced architecture documentation with temporal reasoning focus
- Added comparison to ChirpIQX (7 layers) and PerchIQX (4 layers)
- Explained why Wake Intelligence has exactly 3 layers (temporal physics)

## The Cormorant Trinity

Wake Intelligence is part of a dimensional intelligence framework:

| System | Dimension | Layers | Domain |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------|
| ChirpIQX | Sound (Communication) | 7 | Fantasy sports breakout analysis |
| PerchIQX | Space (Structure) | 4 | Database schema intelligence |
| WakeIQX | Time (Memory) | 3 | AI context management |
